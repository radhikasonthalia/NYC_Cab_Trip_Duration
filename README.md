# NYC_Cab_Trip_Duration
In this competition we build a model that predicts the total ride duration of taxi trips in New York City. 
The primary dataset is one released by the NYC Taxi and Limousine Commission, which includes pickup time, geo-coordinates, number of passengers, and several other variables.

We use this to perform EDA,feature engineering and finally try various Machine Learning models to accurately predict the trip duration.

Techniques Used:
1. Extensive Feature Engineering using HavenSine Function to calcukate distances from Latitudes and Longitudes
2. Usage of datetime to extract hidden information in date and time data
3. In-Depth EDA to assist modeling and Feature Engineering to understand the Dataset
4. Various Machine Learning Algorithms such as: RandomForestRegressor, XGBoostRegressor etc for numeric prediction
